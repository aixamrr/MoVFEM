!! GETNP2 seeks the closest unmarked node to a point.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    GETNP2 uses the cell method to find the closest unmarked node NP
!    to a specified point P, given a set of N nodes and the data structure 
!    defined by STORE2.
!
!    NP is then marked by negating LNEXT(NP).  Thus, the closest M nodes to
!    P may be determined by a sequence of M calls to this routine.  
!
!    If the point P is itself actually a node K, and you want to find the
!    nearest point to P that is not node K, then you must be sure to mark
!    node K before calling.
!
!    The search is begun in the cell containing or closest to P and proceeds 
!    outward in rectangular layers until all cells which contain points 
!    within distance R of P have been searched.  R is the distance from P to 
!    the first unmarked node encountered, or infinite if no unmarked nodes
!    are present.
!
!    Input parameters other than LNEXT are not altered by this routine.  
!    With the exception of ( PX, PY ) and the signs of LNEXT elements, 
!    these parameters should be unaltered from their values on output 
!    from subroutine STORE2.

!    ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software,
!    Volume 14, 1988, pages 149-150.
!
!  Parameters:
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) PX, PY, the (X,Y) coordinates of the point P
!    whose nearest unmarked neighbor is to be found.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) X(N), Y(N), the coordinates of the nodes at which
!    data has been supplied.
!
!    Input, integer NR, the number of rows and columns in the cell grid.
!    NR must be at least 1.
!
!    Input, integer LCELL(NR,NR), array of nodal indices associated
!    with cells.
!
!    Input/output, integer LNEXT(N), contains next-node indices ( or their 
!    negatives ).  On return, if the output value of NP is nonzero, then
!    LNEXT(NP) will be negative.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) XMIN, YMIN, DX, DY, the minimum nodal X, Y
!    coordinates, and the X, Y dimensions of a cell.  DX and DY must be
!    positive.
!
!    Output, integer NP, the index into the vectors X and Y of the nearest
!    unmarked node to the point P.  NP will be 0 if all nodes are marked 
!    or if the values of NR, DX, DY are illegal.  LNEXT(NP) will be less
!    than 0 if NP is nonzero (this marks node NP as being used now).
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) DSQ, if NP is nonzero, then DSQ is the 
!    squared distance between P and node NP.
!
!  Local Parameters:
!
!    first = true iff the first unmarked node has yet to be encountered,
!
!    imin, imax, jmin, jmax = cell indices defining the range of the search,
!
!    delx, dely = px-xmin and py-ymin,
!
!    i0, j0 = cell containing or closest to P,
!
!    i1, i2, j1, j2 = cell indices of the layer whose intersection with 
!    the range defined by imin,...,jmax is currently being searched.

!! GIVENS constructs a Givens plane rotation.

!    The transformation has the form of a 2 by 2 matrix G(C,S):
!
!      (   C  S )
!      ( - S  C )
!
!    where C*C + S*S = 1, which zeroes the second entry of the
!    the column vector ( A, B ) when C and S are properly chosen.

!  Discussion:
!
!    QSHEP2 computes a set of parameters A and RSQ defining a smooth, 
!    once continuously differentiable, bi-variate function Q(X,Y) which 
!    interpolates given data values F at scattered nodes (X,Y).  
!
!    The interpolant function Q(X,Y) may be evaluated at an arbitrary point 
!    by passing the parameters A and RSQ to the function QS2VAL.  The
!    first derivatives dQdX(X,Y) and dQdY(X,Y) may be evaluated by 
!    subroutine QS2GRD.
!
!    The interpolation scheme is a modified quadratic Shepard method:
!
!      Q = ( W(1) * Q(1) + W(2) * Q(2) + .. + W(N) * Q(N) ) 
!        / ( W(1)        + W(2)        + .. + W(N) )
!
!    for bivariate functions W(K) and Q(K).  The nodal functions are given by
!
!      Q(K)(X,Y) = 
!          F(K)
!        + A(1,K) * ( X - X(K) )**2 
!        + A(2,K) * ( X - X(K) ) * ( Y - Y(K) )
!        + A(3,K) * ( Y - Y(K) )**2 
!        + A(4,K) * ( X - X(K) )
!        + A(5,K) * ( Y - Y(K) ).
!
!    Thus, Q(K) is a quadratic function which interpolates the
!    data value at node K.  Its coefficients A(*,K) are obtained
!    by a weighted least squares fit to the closest NQ data
!    points with weights similar to W(K).  Note that the radius
!    of influence for the least squares fit is fixed for each
!    K, but varies with K.
!
!    The weights are taken to be
!
!      W(K)(X,Y) = ( (R(K)-D(K))+ / R(K) * D(K) )**2
!
!    where (R(K)-D(K))+ = 0 if R(K) <= D(K) and D(K)(X,Y) is
!    the euclidean distance between (X,Y) and (X(K),Y(K)).  The
!    radius of influence R(K) varies with K and is chosen so
!    that NW nodes are within the radius.  Note that W(K) is
!    not defined at node (X(K),Y(K)), but Q(X,Y) has limit F(K)
!    as (X,Y) approaches (X(K),Y(K)).

!! STORE2 creates a cell data structure for the scattered data.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    STORE2 is given a set of N arbitrarily distributed nodes in the 
!    plane and creates a data structure for a cell-based method of 
!    solving closest-point problems.  The smallest rectangle containing 
!    all the nodes is partitioned into an NR by NR uniform grid of cells, 
!    and nodes are associated with cells.      
!
!    In particular, the data structure stores the indices of the nodes 
!    contained in each cell.  For a uniform random distribution of nodes, 
!    the nearest node to an arbitrary point can be determined in constant
!    expected time.

!
!  Parameters:
!
!    Input, integer N, the number of data nodes.  N must be at least 2.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) X(N), Y(N), the coordinates of the data nodes.
!
!    Input, integer NR, the number of rows and columns in the grid.  The
!    cell density, or average number of data nodes per cell, is
!      D = N / ( NR * NR ).
!    A recommended value, based on empirical evidence, is 
!      D = 3.

!
!    Output, integer LCELL(NR,NR), an array set up so that LCELL(I,J)

!
!    Output, integer LNEXT(N), an array of next-node indices.  LNEXT(K)
!    contains the index of the next node in the cell which contains node K, 
!    or LNEXT(K) = K if K is the last node in the cell.
!    The data nodes contained in a cell are ordered by their indices.

!      LNEXT(5) = 5.
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) XMIN, YMIN, the X, Y coordinates of the lower
!    left corner of the rectangle defined by the data nodes.  The upper right 
!    corner is ( XMAX, YMAX ), where
!      XMAX = XMIN + NR * DX,
!      YMAX = YMIN + NR * DY.
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) DX, DY, the X and Y dimensions of the 
!    individual cells.
!      DX = ( XMAX - XMIN ) / NR
!      DY = ( YMAX - YMIN ) / NR,
!    where XMIN, XMAX, YMIN and YMAX are the extrema of X and Y.
!
!    Output, integer IER, an error indicator.
