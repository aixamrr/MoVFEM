# MoVFEM
Multi-order Vector Finite Element Method, a computational algorithm for the modeling of 3D Magnetotelluric (MT) data using a Vector Finite Element Method of specific order from multiple elements' orders. Our algorithm allows complex geometries, topography, and anisotropic resistivity structures.
